# Global Games Jam 2019

### TODO: Add actual game name

We find our main character at home, their 40th birthday is coming up, it's a real drag trying to throw one but this year will be different. If only there was some way to get more people you actually want to show up (for the love of god I hope it's not Carl again...).

You're the helpful, party demon that's just been summoned to solve all our main character's problems. If only they weren't such a dumb... Maybe if you... ope, looks like you're now inside their body? I guess that works. It's time to make this the best 40th birthday party they've never had.

* 2D graphics, Pixijs-based
